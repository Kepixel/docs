## Getting Started

### Installation

To start using Kepixel on your website, add the following tracking code to the `<head>` section of your HTML pages:

```html
<!-- Kepixel Tracking Code -->
<script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
        _paq.push(['setAppId', 'YOUR_APP_ID']);
        var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
        g.async=true; g.src='https://edge.kepixel.com/anubis.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
    })();
</script>
<!-- End Kepixel Tracking Code -->
```

Replace `'YOUR_APP_ID'` with your actual application ID and update the script source URL to point to your hosted version of anubis.js.

### Basic Usage

Once installed, Kepixel automatically tracks page views and link clicks. You can track additional user interactions using the Anubis.js tracking library:

```javascript
// Track an event
_paq.push(['trackEvent', 'Category', 'Action', 'Name', 'Value']);

// Track a purchase
_paq.push(['trackPurchase', 'ORDER123', 'USD', 69.97, items, 'Example purchase', user_data, custom_data]);
```
